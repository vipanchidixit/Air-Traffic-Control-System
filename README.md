Project: Designed an airport's operational system that includes plane handling, air traffic control (ATC), and logistical procedures. The system managed planes concurrently and allocated runways dynamically according to operational requirements by using C programming in conjunction with pthreads, message queues, and system calls. Strict error handling procedures and recording guaranteed ongoing operation. The project's success demonstrated the team's mastery of system programming, multithreading, and efficient Git version control, which led to an optimized solution that improved airport productivity overall.
